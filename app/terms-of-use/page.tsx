If direct negotiations do not succeed within a period of 30 days from the initiation of such negotiation, the Parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation and binding arbitration under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association utilizing its International Dispute Resolution Procedures as in effect at the time the dispute is submitted for mediation and arbitration. Should mediation not result in the resolution of the dispute, the matter will be referred to binding arbitration on the AAA’s International Dispute Resolution Procedures. Such arbitration will be before a single arbitrator with any hearings or other proceedings to take place in Pennsylvania, USA, or in such other location as the Parties may agree. All administrative costs and the fees for the mediator(s) and/or arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be borne equally by the Parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to allocate the administrative costs and fees, including those of the mediator/arbitrator, between the parties based on the outcome of the arbitration proceedings. In exercising this discretion, the arbitrator may consider factors such as the degree of success achieved by each Party, the conduct of the Parties during the arbitration, and any other relevant circumstances. The arbitrator's determination of cost allocation shall be final and binding on the Parties. Each Party shall bear its own expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert witness costs. The decision by the arbitrator shall be final, binding, and non-appealable, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any remedy that would be available from a court of law or equity (including injunctive relief) shall be available from the arbitrator. In the event that the arbitrator determines, in their sole discretion, that a Party has engaged in bad faith conduct during the arbitration proceedings, including but not limited to frivolous claims, obstruction of the arbitration process, or any other conduct contrary to the principles of fair and efficient resolution, the arbitrator may, at their discretion, allocate the costs, including attorneys' fees and expert witness costs, to the Party found to have acted in bad faith. The determination of bad faith shall be based on an objective standard and shall not be made lightly. The Party seeking recovery of costs under this provision shall bear the burden of proving the opposing Party's bad faith. The arbitration hearing shall be commenced within ninety (90) days of the filing of the demand for arbitration by either Party, and the award shall be rendered within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of such hearing.<br />

      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg">19. CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h4>

      <p className="text-sm">
        You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg">20. EQUITABLE RELIEF</h4>

      <p className="text-sm">
        You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for purposes of any such action by us.

      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg">21. CONTROLLING LAW; EXCLUSIVE FORUM</h4>

      <p className="text-sm">
        The Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The Parties hereby consent and agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commonwealth and federal courts located in the Commonwealth of California for all suits, actions, or proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and waive any and all objections to such courts, including but not limited to, objections based on improper venue or inconvenient forum, and each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suits, actions, or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg">22. MISCELLANEOUS</h4>

      <p className="text-sm">
        You may not assign any of your rights, duties, or obligations under these Terms of Use to any person or entity, in whole or in part, without written consent from Pennhealth. Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed to by us and you in writing, the Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter.

      <p className="text-sm">
        a. Term: The Term of this BAA shall become effective as of the Effective Date and shall terminate when all of the PHI provided by Covered Entity to Business Associate, or created or received by Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity, is destroyed or returned to Covered Entity, or, if it is infeasible to return or destroy PHI, protections are extended to such information, in accordance with the termination provisions of this Section.

        b. Material Breach: A material breach by either party of any provision of this BAA shall constitute a material breach of the BAA, if such breach is not cured by the breaching party within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice describing the material breach.<br /><br />
        c. Reasonable Steps to Cure Breach: If either party learns of an activity or practice of the other party that constitutes a material breach or violation of the other party’s obligations under the provisions of this BAA, then the non-breaching party shall notify the breaching party of the breach and the breaching party shall take reasonable steps to cure such breach or violation, as applicable, within a period of time which shall in no event exceed thirty (30) days.

This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of Business Associate.<br /><br />
        In the event that Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, Business Associate shall provide to Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the parties that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, Business Associate shall extend the protections of this BAA to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as Business Associate maintains such PHI. The obligations of Business Associate under this Section shall survive the termination of the BAA.<br /><br />

      </p>
